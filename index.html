    <div>
        <h2 class="aot">Attack on titan</h2>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.rwwnhRMdajnGmiYlic3-BQHaEK?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="aot">
        <p>This show is very explicit and shows alot of graphic but it's a good one overall so It's
            basically about this young boy avenging the death of his mother from these horrific creatures called
            titans that came crashing down the walls of a little village for humans to live in and ever since
            then he vows to get rid of all titans with the help of his team and his closest friends being with him
            through every step of the way and knowing that they got each other back through anything.

        <h2>My Hero Acadamia</h2>
        <img src="https://image.winudf.com/v2/image/Y29tLmFuZHJvbW8uZGV2NjYwNjE0LmFwcDcyODQ4NF9zY3JlZW5fNl8xNTI1NzI2NDA4XzA5NA/screen-6.jpg?fakeurl=1&type=.jpg" alt="MHA"class="MHA">
        <p>this show is one of my favorites because he had a goal in mind to become one of the biggest
            heroes of all time and he trained his butt off to become stronger day by day and it really showed that
            if you serious about something you would go for it no matter the cost of anything, the ball is in your hands
            so you decide what you gonna do it with the end of the day.

        <h2>Naruto</h2>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.392400be505033aa40aa750bc63d9813?rik=23CKMQGlA06%2f3w&riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f_FNQgkfCwYxs%2fTAfWtsNbv4I%2fAAAAAAAAB90%2fyq4yHzfgr20%2fs1600%2fanime-naruto-wallpaper.jpg&ehk=oN%2b%2bqWdrzjb%2bCNEKxRHj1BWP4VZcGvu558S21c%2ffM5g%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="naruto"class="naruto">
        <p>This is an anime about a young ninja who seeks value ans recognition  from his peers he has showed
            that you can do anything that you wanna do just believe in yourself </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Demon Slayer</h2>
        <img src="https://inoridonz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/demonslayer_kimetsunoyaiba_01.jpg" alt="DS"class="DS">
        <p>I loved this show from the start of it because of it's message behind of it all,
            It's about this special boy who trained to become a demon hunter because his whole
            family gotten killed because of demons invaded their place of peace and out of everyone that died, 
            his sister was the only one that came out alive but she turned out as a demon herself so then he went on
            a quest to find a way to get his sister to go back to a human being and the reason why i really loved this show
            is because if you really care about somebody you go through alot to protect them at all costs and
            making sure that they're safe no matter what.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>One Punch man</h2>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.5Yu0VRmmiTGfDCu6ucoedAHaFj?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="ONE"class="ONE">
        <p>I relley enjoyed this anime from beginning to end because of the Excitement through out 
            It's about a super hero who has become bored in his life be cause of the lack of a challenge from
            his day to day life.
